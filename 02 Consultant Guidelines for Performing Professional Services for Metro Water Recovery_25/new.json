In 2016, Olsson revisited its analysis of the site and updated the master plan to reflect construction to date, alternate building layouts, revised cost estimates and phasing plans. Olsson has advised UNL and their development partners about potential growth and phasing options to maximize the use of the existing infrastructure and provided parking options for reasonable access to the various buildings. Olsson reviewed the existing master plan, developed an inventory of current infrastructure, identified logical building pad sites, and determined areas ready to be developed. The master plan provided a series of buildout phases that identified each building and associated parking facilities. Erin has been involved with the campus master plan analysis and development since 2014 and has been civil engineer of record for the development of new campus infrastructure and building site construction.
