He led the design of mass grading, retaining walls, and stormwater pollution prevention plans for 80 acres of land. The design services included the completion of roadway and intersection design plans for nearly two miles of roadway and two bridges for the community of 100. Challenges/Successes: Civil engineering components of the project required extensive permitting through state agencies due to its remote location. Consistent coordination with these agencies ensured permits would be approved on schedule. The project included eight different architectural firms, each designing a separate building. The civil design responded to each unique building and the natural features of the site, employing low impact design practices and preserving much of the natural landscape. | Size: 160 Acres | Cost: Confidential | Role: Civil Engineer",
