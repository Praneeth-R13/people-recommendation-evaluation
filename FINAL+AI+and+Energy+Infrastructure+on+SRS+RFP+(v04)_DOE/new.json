Site/civil design followed UFC 3-201-01 Civil Engineering and UFC 1-200-01 DoD Building Code. He conducted a stormwater study to evaluate site runoff including runoff calculations to determine volume of stormwater. This study was essential for compliance with the Energy Independence and Security Act, which mandates that a site retain runoff from the 95th percentile rain event to the maximum extent feasible. Jared addressed this with design of a stormwater extended detention and underdrain system, which reduced peak discharge and improved water quality. He implemented a SWPPP following UFC 1-200-02.

The project is divided into two phases: the study phase, and the design phase. The study phase included in depth review and analysis of the existing stormwater system and site information. He led a team on-site to investigate the source of subsurface groundwater that was leading to the deterioration of the concrete apron. Through hydraulic modeling, his analysis determined the existing stormwater system was undersized and faulty, exacerbating the poor paving conditions. Jon led the civil engineering design of the F-35 Apron Replacement, performing engineering studies, hydraulic modeling, design, and preparation of preliminary and final design drawings and specifications. As part of the preliminary engineering, Jon conducted pre-design site assessments and design charette meetings with USAF and NAVFAC staff. Construction was complete in 2022. Challenges/Successes: Resiliency to storms and large stormwater flows is crucial to the success of any aviation project. Poor record drawings, sealed drainage structures, and years of apron pavement buildup provided a difficult task to assess the source of ongoing pavement damage.

Rail construction included 43,000+ track feet with triple loop, lead tracks, wye track configurations, bad order tracks, and 14 loadout spots with loadrack structure and loadout building. The project was successfully completed to increase efficiency and improve economics of transferring domestic crude from the Bakken production area to refineries on the east and west coasts. Olsson’s responsibilities included rail design, site/civil and grading design, H&H analysis and culvert design, roadway design for onsite and offsite roadway improvements, geotechnical analysis, structural foundations design and onsite testing services (e.g., concrete, soils, gradations).",

The new proposed industrial track branches from the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) Coffeyville Subdivision. Total track construction includes 3,759 track feet, including receiving and departure, staging, bad order, and locomotive runaround tracks. All track design and construction met UPRR standards and requirements.
